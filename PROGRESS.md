# Progress

Tracer-bullet backlog: `.scratch/freesound-desktop-v1/`. Ticket 09 (the milestone) is
built and its macOS drag-out was manually verified by the user on 2026-08-30. Ticket 10
(sidecars + LRU eviction) is done. Frontier is now tickets 11 and 15.

## Test counts

- `apps/desktop`: 105 vitest tests (+11 for ticket 10), `tsc --noEmit` clean, `electron-vite build` clean.
- `worker`: 30 vitest tests, `tsc --noEmit` clean.
- `spike/drag-out`: syntax-checked only (throwaway).

## Ticket 10 — what landed

- `src/core/staging/eviction.ts` — the eviction/accounting seam:
  - `evictStagedOverBudget(db, dataDir, byteBudget, inFlightDrags)` — sums
    `staged_entries.byte_size`, and while over budget removes
    least-recently-accessed Staged Sounds first (`listStagedEntries` is already
    `ORDER BY last_access_at ASC`). Each removal is whole: Original unlinked
    FIRST, then the sidecar, then the `staged_entries` row — an interrupted pass
    can only ever leave a harmless sidecar-without-audio, never the reverse.
  - Never evicts a Sound with a `library_entries` row or one flagged by
    `InFlightDrags` — reported in `skipped`, never forced out.
  - `clearStaged(...)` — same removal, no budget, for `core.clearStaged()`.
  - `computeDiskUsage(db, dataDir)` — `{ staged, library, total }`; Library bytes
    by stat-ing each Library Original (no size column, schema stays append-only).
  - `DEFAULT_STAGING_BYTE_BUDGET = 2 GiB`.
- `src/core/staging/dragRegistry.ts` — `createDragRegistry()`: a ref-counted set
  of Sound ids with a live Drag-Out, each entry self-expiring after a 120 s TTL
  (unref'd timer) so a missed `dragend` can never pin a Sound forever. This is
  the `InFlightDrags` seam eviction consults.
- `src/core/staging/dragController.ts` — `startDrag` now calls
  `dragRegistry.begin(soundIds)` after handing the drag to the OS.
- `src/core/staging/stagingController.ts` — after `onComplete` writes the new
  `staged_entries` row it calls `scheduleEviction()`, which runs the pass on
  `setImmediate` (off the audition hot path, coalesced, fully async, failures
  swallowed — the user is never told). Adds `getDiskUsage()` / `clearStaged()`.
  New deps: `byteBudget`, `inFlightDrags`.
- `src/core/index.ts` — `CoreDeps.stagingByteBudget?`; constructs the shared
  `dragRegistry` and threads it into staging + drag; new commands
  `getDiskUsage()`, `clearStaged()`, `endDrag(soundIds)`; `close()` clears the
  registry.
- `src/preload/index.ts` — `getDiskUsage` / `clearStaged` / `endDrag` on the
  bridge (`core:invoke` passthrough — no `src/main` change needed).
- `src/renderer/components/ResultRow.tsx` — `onDragEnd` calls
  `window.core.endDrag([sound.id])` so the eviction-skip hold is released
  whatever the drop outcome.
- `test/eviction.test.ts` — 11 tests covering every bullet of the ticket's
  "Tests cover:" line (sidecar accompanies every download; budget exceeded →
  LRU-first eviction, both via the pure function and via the live audition path;
  skips Library Sounds; skips live-hardlink Sounds; audio + sidecar removed
  together; `clearStaged` leaves the Library untouched) plus `getDiskUsage`
  split and the zero case.

### Deferrals / judgement calls (ticket 10)

- **No new migration.** The ticket allowed appending `m003` for a Library size
  column; not needed — `staged_entries.byte_size` already exists and Library
  bytes are cheap to stat (row count is tiny; `library_entries` is still empty
  until ticket 11).
- **Eviction is not a worker thread** (the ticket said one is not required). It
  is async `node:fs` work on `setImmediate`; revisit with the other main-thread
  offloads noted for ticket 18 if staging ever holds thousands of rows.
- **In-flight-drag TTL is 120 s.** Belt-and-braces only — the renderer's
  `dragend` is the real signal; the hardlink already keeps a dropped file alive
  after eviction (`docs/findings/0002` §A7).
- `<userData>/drag/` hardlinks are still never swept (unchanged from ticket 09 —
  ticket 18).

## Ticket 09 — what landed

- `src/core/staging/dragHost.ts` — `DragHost` boundary + `createRecordingDragHost` (test fake).
- `src/core/staging/dragController.ts` — `startDrag()`: resolves Sounds, refuses any whose
  Original is not on disk (`OriginalNotStagedError` — never a Preview), hardlinks each
  Original into `<userData>/drag/` under a sanitised name with `(2)`, `(3)` collision
  disambiguation, resolves a never-empty icon, calls `DragHost` once.
- `src/core/index.ts` — `core.startDrag()` + `core.getDragCapabilities()`; new
  `dragHost` / `dragIconFallbackPath` deps.
- `src/main/dragHost.ts` — production `DragHost` over `webContents.startDrag`;
  `multiFileDragSupported = darwin only` (electron#9019).
- `src/main/index.ts` — constructs it; resolves `resources/drag-icon.png`.
- `src/preload/index.ts` — `startDrag` / `getDragCapabilities` on the bridge.
- `src/renderer/components/ResultRow.tsx` — every row `draggable`; `dragstart` sends the
  Sound's waveform as the drag icon and shows a visible message when refused.
- `src/renderer/lib/dragIcon.ts` — best-effort waveform-PNG → data URL.
- `apps/desktop/resources/drag-icon.png` + `scripts/make-drag-icon.mjs` — bundled fallback glyph.
- `test/drag.test.ts` — 9 tests covering every item in the ticket's test list.

## Still open for ticket 09

- **Run `docs/findings/0002` §A/§B/§C/§D** on real macOS + Windows against Logic /
  Audacity / Final Cut / Ableton / the file manager. The milestone is not proven until
  §A is green.
- Multi-Sound drag is core-ready + gated but not surfaced (no multi-select UI until 13).
- `<userData>/drag/` is never swept — deferred to ticket 18.
- Fallback icon into `electron-builder` `extraResources` — ticket 19.

## Known follow-ups noted by the ticket agents

- Rate-limit question (SETUP.md §2) must be answered before shipping OAuth.
- `better-sqlite3` needs a rebuild on Node/Electron ABI changes (ticket 19 / `@electron/rebuild`).
- Renderer bundle is ~620 kB and unsplit — fine for an Electron app, revisit at ticket 18.
- Hand-crafted Freesound fixtures (`apps/desktop/test/fixtures/freesound/`) should be
  re-recorded against a real API key.
