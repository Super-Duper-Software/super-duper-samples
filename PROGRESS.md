# Progress

Tracer-bullet backlog: `.scratch/freesound-desktop-v1/`. Ticket 09 (the milestone) is
built and its macOS drag-out was manually verified by the user on 2026-08-30. Frontier is
now tickets 10, 11 and 15.

| 08 | Staged download on audition | done | `4ed08ee` |
| 09 | Real drag-out — **the milestone** | **done** — code + tests + macOS manual verification (`docs/findings/0002`); Windows §B still outstanding | `72fdf0d` |

## Test counts

- `apps/desktop`: 94 vitest tests (+9 for ticket 09), `tsc --noEmit` clean, `electron-vite build` clean.
- `worker`: 30 vitest tests, `tsc --noEmit` clean.
- `spike/drag-out`: syntax-checked only (throwaway).

## Ticket 09 — what landed

- `src/core/staging/dragHost.ts` — `DragHost` boundary + `createRecordingDragHost` (test fake).
- `src/core/staging/dragController.ts` — `startDrag()`: resolves Sounds, refuses any whose
  Original is not on disk (`OriginalNotStagedError` — never a Preview), hardlinks each
  Original into `<userData>/drag/` under a sanitised name with `(2)`, `(3)` collision
  disambiguation, resolves a never-empty icon, calls `DragHost` once.
- `src/core/index.ts` — `core.startDrag()` + `core.getDragCapabilities()`; new
  `dragHost` / `dragIconFallbackPath` deps.
- `src/main/dragHost.ts` — production `DragHost` over `webContents.startDrag`;
  `multiFileDragSupported = darwin only` (electron#9019).
- `src/main/index.ts` — constructs it; resolves `resources/drag-icon.png`.
- `src/preload/index.ts` — `startDrag` / `getDragCapabilities` on the bridge.
- `src/renderer/components/ResultRow.tsx` — every row `draggable`; `dragstart` sends the
  Sound's waveform as the drag icon and shows a visible message when refused.
- `src/renderer/lib/dragIcon.ts` — best-effort waveform-PNG → data URL.
- `apps/desktop/resources/drag-icon.png` + `scripts/make-drag-icon.mjs` — bundled fallback glyph.
- `test/drag.test.ts` — 9 tests covering every item in the ticket's test list.

## Still open for ticket 09

- **Run `docs/findings/0002` §A/§B/§C/§D** on real macOS + Windows against Logic /
  Audacity / Final Cut / Ableton / the file manager. The milestone is not proven until
  §A is green.
- Multi-Sound drag is core-ready + gated but not surfaced (no multi-select UI until 13).
- `<userData>/drag/` is never swept — deferred to ticket 18.
- Fallback icon into `electron-builder` `extraResources` — ticket 19.

## Known follow-ups noted by the ticket agents

- Rate-limit question (SETUP.md §2) must be answered before shipping OAuth.
- `better-sqlite3` needs a rebuild on Node/Electron ABI changes (ticket 19 / `@electron/rebuild`).
- Renderer bundle is ~620 kB and unsplit — fine for an Electron app, revisit at ticket 18.
- Hand-crafted Freesound fixtures (`apps/desktop/test/fixtures/freesound/`) should be
  re-recorded against a real API key.
